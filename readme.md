README
======

the general idea behind this project is to create a script that makes a screenshot every 3 to 5 sec and calculate the average color of the pixels at the border of the screen. The color code (rgb) will be sent to an arduino etc. which again sends it to some neopixel led stripes placed at the backside of the screen. 


choices made 
------------

1. Script language: 
i have chosen python because i wanted to learn how to code in python, and also it seemed easy because of all the libraries at the internet

2. AVR / Arduino: 
cheap and easy available, easy to program, is sufficient, that's why

3. NeoPixel / WS2812
great LED strip with seperate programmable LEDs, widely available, had some laying around




for your information
--------------------
i am by far no experienced programmer and may have made some mistakes or did made some unconventional programming but i am open to suggestions regarding my code. you can use this code for your project, but i will not take any responsibility for any results.
